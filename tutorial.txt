Advanced ML Project: Real-Time Financial Fraud Detection with Explainable AI Dashboard
This project is designed to showcase your expertise in machine learning, modern web frameworks, and production-level deployment. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the project, including the technologies, architecture, and demo features.

Project Overview
You will build a real-time financial fraud detection system that analyzes streaming transaction data, predicts fraudulent activities, and explains its decisions to users through an interactive web dashboard. The system leverages state-of-the-art ML models and a modern, scalable tech stack, making it highly relevant for tech internships.

1. Data Pipeline
Goal: Ingest and process financial transaction data in real time.
Dataset: Start with a public synthetic dataset like the IBM Telco or Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset. These datasets contain labeled transactions (fraud/not fraud) with features such as amount, merchant, timestamp, and user ID.
Streaming: Use Apache Kafka or Redis Streams to simulate real-time transaction flow, mimicking how banks process payments.

Feature Engineering:
Extract temporal patterns (e.g., frequency of transactions, time since last transaction).
Build transaction graphs (users as nodes, transactions as edges) to capture relationships and unusual behavior.

2. Model Development
Goal: Build and train a robust, explainable ML model for fraud detection.
Model Architecture:
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Analyze relationships between accounts and detect suspicious transaction patterns.
Tabular Model (XGBoost): Handle structured features (amount, location, device, etc.).
Autoencoders: Unsupervised anomaly detection for new, unseen fraud patterns.
Temporal Fusion Transformers: Capture sequential and temporal dependencies in transaction data.

Training:
Use PyTorch Lightning for scalable, modular model training.
Address class imbalance with techniques like focal loss or SMOTE.
Evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score, aiming for high recall to minimize missed frauds.

3. Backend API
Goal: Serve predictions and explanations via a scalable API.
Framework: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance REST endpoints.
Endpoints:
/predict: Accepts transaction data, returns fraud probability and model explanation.
/feedback: Allows users to flag incorrect predictions for model improvement.
Real-Time Processing: Integrate with Kafka/Redis to process and score transactions as they arrive.

4. Frontend Dashboard
Goal: Provide an interactive, real-time dashboard for users and analysts.
Framework: React.js for a responsive, modern UI.
Features:
Live Transaction Feed: Displays incoming transactions and their fraud scores.
Visualization: Use D3.js or TensorFlow.js to show:
Transaction graphs (highlight suspicious nodes/edges)
SHAP value plots explaining model decisions for each transaction
Feedback Mechanism: Users can flag transactions as false positives/negatives, which are sent back to the backend for model retraining.
User Experience: Emphasize clarity, speed, and actionable insights.

5. Deployment & MLOps
Goal: Deploy a production-ready, scalable system.
Containerization: Use Docker to package backend, frontend, and model components.
Orchestration: Deploy with Kubernetes (e.g., AWS EKS) for scalability and reliability.
Monitoring: Integrate MLflow for experiment tracking and Evidently AI for monitoring model drift and data quality.
CI/CD: Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

6. Demo Website Features
Landing Page: Brief project overview and instructions.

Live Demo: Users can submit transactions and view fraud predictions instantly.

Explainability: Interactive SHAP plots show which features influenced each prediction.

Analytics: Real-time charts of fraud detection rates, false positives/negatives, and model performance.

Admin Panel: Review flagged transactions and retrain model with new feedback.

Why This Project Stands Out
End-to-End Solution: Demonstrates ability to build, deploy, and maintain a full-stack ML system.

Modern Techniques: Uses GNNs, Transformers, and explainable AI—skills in high demand.

Real-World Impact: Tackles a genuine business problem (fraud detection).

User-Centric: Focus on explainability and user feedback, showing awareness of practical deployment challenges.
